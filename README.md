# Getting Started with Gaudi
Here's a brief overview of content that will be available soon on Habana GitHub (github.com/HabanaAI). Developers will have access concurrent with availability of Gaudi-based servers on-premise or in the cloud.  
**We recommend you "watch" for more updates. Stay tuned!**


* Setup and installation: Instructions on how to access and install Habana drivers on bare metal, setting up the environment with Gaudi firmware and drivers, installing SynapseAI TensorFlow and PyTorch containers, and running with containers. Will also contain Dockerfiles and instructions to build your own Docker images for SynapseAI with TensorFlow or PyTorch. 

* Reference models: Examples of DL training models (primarily vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems) that run on Gaudi. Each model comes with model scripts, recipes, expected results and tutorials. Initial list of TensorFlow models will include ResNet50, BERT-Large, ResNext101, SSD-ResNet34 and MaskRCNN.  PyTorch models will include BERT-Large and DLRM.
